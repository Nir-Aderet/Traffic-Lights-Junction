# Traffic-Lights-Junction

The program uses JavaFX to simulate traffic lights in a junction.

The round traffic lights are for the cars and the rectangled traffic lights are for pedstrians.

Each traffic light is realized by a thread so that the entire system of traffic lights would stay always synchronized.
